      river keeps rising &amp; has
      <lb n="29"/>
      <pb n="286"/>

      Balulshenghi &amp; got home
      <lb n="5"/>

      the Other priests were not there
      <lb n="13"/>
      as they decline going anywhere,
      <lb n="14"/>
      as the Khalifah will be

      detained here till Sunday
      <lb n="16"/>
      (for she has not yet gone alongside
      <lb n="17"/>
      to discharge &amp; the Baghdad
      <lb n="18"/>
      &amp; Phrat being inside) So
      <lb n="19"/>
      Eliza thinks of going down
      <lb n="20"/>
      in the Khalifah to Basreh
      <lb n="21"/>
